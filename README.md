Not much to see here yet.

Ideally this should:
- [x] decode an asyncapi spec
- [ ] be able to generate the schema for the models in `avro`, `json` and `protobuf` formats
- [ ] be able to generate the scala code for the models

Similar to https://github.com/higherkindness/skeuomorph and https://github.com/higherkindness/sbt-mu-srcgen, but without recursive schemes and targeting [asyncapi](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0).
